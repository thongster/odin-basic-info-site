Project: Basic Informational Site from The Odin Project's NodeJS Course

A basic nodeJS project where I had to use http.createServer and fs.readFile in order to create my own routing to the index, about, and contact me pages. If the link visited was incorrect, a 404 error page was displayed.

This taught me on a lower level how to deal with http requests and how to conditionally display pages based on the url being requested. 

I also used one of the conditional statements to serve the css stylesheet which required using the writeHead to identify the css file.
